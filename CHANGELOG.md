## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-08

### Performance
- Chunked parallel processing with `par_chunks(64)` for reduced thread synchronization overhead (+20-60% multi-thread performance)
- SIMD-accelerated hex decoding via `faster-hex` crate
- Enabled ASM features for `md-5`, `sha1`, `sha2` crates (benefits CPUs with SHA-NI support)

### Changed
- Updated to Rust Edition 2024

### Benchmark Improvements (4-core Intel)
| Hash | v0.8.0 | v0.8.1 | Improvement |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| MD5 | 7.58 MH/s | 8.05 MH/s | +6% |
| SHA256 | 2.41 MH/s | 2.94 MH/s | +22% |
| SHA512 | 1.90 MH/s | 2.28 MH/s | +20% |
| SHA3-256 | 1.21 MH/s | 1.78 MH/s | +47% |

- Rule-based transformations connected to cracker (`--rules` / `-r` flag)
- Dual auto-detection for SHA256/SHA3-256 hashes
- Hash type validation before cracking loop
- Documentation: `docs/usage.md`, `docs/examples.md`

### Fixed
- `Cargo.toml` version synced correctly
- `Cargo.toml` edition corrected from "2024" to "2021"
- Help text now lists bcrypt and ntlm as supported types
